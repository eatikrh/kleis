# Cursor AI Rules for this Project

## Git Repository Rules

**CRITICAL: NEVER push to any git repository without explicit user permission.**

- You may stage files (`git add`)
- You may commit files (`git commit`)
- You must ALWAYS ask before running `git push`
- Stop after committing and ask: "The changes are committed. Would you like me to push to GitHub now?"
- Wait for explicit "yes" or "push" command from the user before executing any `git push` operation
- This rule applies to ALL branches and ALL remotes

## General Guidelines

- Follow user instructions carefully
- Ask for clarification when uncertain
- Be respectful of the user's workflow and preferences
