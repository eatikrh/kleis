= Chapter 1: Introduction

Knowledge production relies on precise notation and rigorous verification.

= Chapter 2: Background

We build on prior work in formal verification and type theory.

= Chapter 3: The Kleis System

Kleis is built on structures, axioms, and templates.

= Chapter 4: Evaluation

We evaluate Kleis on tensor calculus and protocol verification.

= Chapter 5: Conclusion

We have presented Kleis, a substrate for formal knowledge production.
