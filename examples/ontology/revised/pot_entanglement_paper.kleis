In POT, entangled particles are not separate systems connected by a mysterious influence — they are spatial manifestations of a single, non-separable ontological wave viewed through different projection angles. The measurement kernel is a sector of the same admissible Green's kernel that governs gravitational physics (shown in our companion paper on flat rotation curves). Our central result is that the singlet correlation E(a,b) = −cos(θ) is not postulated but *derived* from five structural assumptions about the ontological Hilbert space ℋ_ont: (A) SU(2) symmetry acts on ontic flows, (B) the projection operator is an SU(2) intertwiner (symmetry survives projection), (C) inner products are SU(2)-invariant, (D) the singlet state is invariant under diagonal SU(2), and (E) probability is governed by a Born-type modal visibility rule. The empirical content is thus encoded in ontic SU(2) symmetry together with its survival under projection, rather than in a correlation formula. From these axioms we prove using the Z3 SMT solver: (1) the singlet-state correlation follows as a representation-theoretic lemma, (2) Bell's inequality holds for all separable states, (3) Bell's inequality is violated for non-separable states, (4) the violation reflects rejection of separability rather than locality, and (5) operational no-signaling holds despite ontic contextuality — marginal statistics at each detector are independent of the remote setting. The CHSH parameter reaches S = 2√2, matching quantum mechanics exactly. We further extend the analysis to three-particle GHZ states, proving that no noncontextual assignment satisfies the GHZ parity constraints (Z3 UNSAT), while POT's context-dependent outcomes satisfy all four constraints simultaneously. Every step is formally verified and reproducible from the accompanying source files."

define sec_intro = ArxivSection("Introduction",
"Since Bell's seminal 1964 theorem, quantum entanglement has occupied a peculiar position in physics: its predictions are confirmed with extraordinary precision, yet its interpretation remains contested. The core puzzle is simple to state: two photons produced in a singlet state, measured at detectors separated by arbitrary distances, show correlations that violate any inequality derivable from local hidden variable theories. The CHSH inequality $S <= 2$ is experimentally violated, with quantum mechanics predicting — and experiments confirming — $S = 2 sqrt(2) approx 2.83$.

The standard interpretation treats this as evidence that nature is fundamentally non-local: measurement of one photon instantaneously determines the state of the other, regardless of separation. The 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics (Aspect, Clauser, Zeilinger) recognized decades of increasingly stringent tests confirming these correlations, with loopholes closed and space-like separation ensured.

Yet the derivation of Bell's theorem contains a premise that is rarely examined: the assumption of *separability*. Bell's factorization $P(a,b) = integral A(a, lambda) dot B(b, lambda) dot rho(lambda) thin d lambda$ presupposes that outcomes at detector A and detector B can be described by *independent* functions $A(a, lambda)$ and $B(b, lambda)$ sharing only a common hidden variable $lambda$. This factorization is not a consequence of locality alone — it is a consequence of treating the two particles as *independently describable systems*.

In this paper, we show that Projected Ontology Theory (POT) reproduces the quantum mechanical predictions — including Bell violation — without non-locality, by rejecting separability at the ontological level. In POT, an 'entangled pair' is not two particles with a mysterious connection; it is a single, non-separable wave in the ontological Hilbert space $cal(H)_(\"ont\")$, expressed at multiple spacetime coordinates. Measurement is not collapse but a context-dependent selection of which modal components survive projection.

A key contribution of this paper is the *derivation* of the singlet correlation E(a,b) = −cos(θ) from deeper structural principles, rather than its assertion as an axiom. We show that SU(2) symmetry lives in the ontological Hilbert space $cal(H)_(\"ont\")$, that this symmetry *survives* the projection to observable spacetime (the projection operator is an SU(2) intertwiner), and that the cosine correlation follows as a representation-theoretic consequence of singlet invariance and the Born-type modal visibility rule. This moves the explanatory burden from 'the correlation happens to be −cos(θ)' to 'the ontic space carries SU(2) symmetry and the projection respects it' — a far more physically grounded starting point.

We also prove a no-signaling theorem: despite the ontic contextuality of POT (measurement outcomes depend on the global projection context), the marginal statistics at each detector are independent of the remote detector setting. This reconciles POT's contextual ontology with operational locality.

Our approach is rigorously formal: every axiom is explicit, every theorem is machine-verified by the Z3 SMT solver through the Kleis verification platform, and the entire derivation builds on the same admissible kernel foundation used in our companion paper on flat galactic rotation curves. The measurement kernel and the gravitational kernel are not separate mechanisms — they are different sectors of a single, factorized projection operator. We further extend the analysis to three-particle GHZ states, proving that POT is not a noncontextual hidden-variable theory — a strictly stronger result than Bell violation alone.")

"We work within the mathematical framework of Projected Ontology Theory, building on the admissible kernel axioms established in our companion paper. The reader unfamiliar with the full POT axiom set is referred to the rotation curves paper for details; here we summarize only what is needed for the entanglement derivation.")

define subsec_admissible_recap = ArxivSubsection("Admissible Kernels (Recap)",
"POT posits three primitive types: Green's kernels $G$, flows $f$ (configurations in a pre-observable space), and fields on $RR^4$ (the observable domain). An *admissible* kernel satisfies linearity (A1–A2) and maps the zero flow to the zero field (A3). Admissible kernels compose: if $G_1$ and $G_2$ are admissible, then $G_1 compose G_2$ is admissible.

These axioms are shared with the gravitational sector — the same mathematical structure that produces flat rotation curves also governs quantum measurement. This is not a coincidence; it reflects the kernel unification principle discussed below.")

define subsec_kernel_factorization = ArxivSubsection("Kernel Factorization",
"The central structural theorem of POT is the *Kernel Unification Theorem*: the projection operator factorizes as
$ K(x, xi) = K_(\"univ\") dot K_(\"dyn\") dot K_(\"rep\") $
where:

- $K_(\"univ\")$ is the universal structural sector (shared by all physics),
- $K_(\"dyn\")$ is the dynamical sector (elliptic for static gravity, hyperbolic for propagation),
- $K_(\"rep\")$ is the representation-dependent sector (scalar for gravity, matrix-valued for spin).

Each sector is individually admissible, and their composition is admissible by the kernel composition axiom. This factorization means that the gravitational kernel $G$ used for rotation curves and the measurement kernel $K(theta)$ used for spin correlations are *not* separate mechanisms — they are different faces of the same underlying operator, activated in different physical regimes.")

"For systems with internal degrees of freedom (spin, polarization, flavor), the projection output is not a scalar field but a spinor-valued field. We introduce the type `SpinorField` with its own linear algebra (addition, scalar multiplication, zero element) satisfying the standard vector space axioms.

The projection operator for spin-½ systems maps a flow $psi$ and a detector angle $a$ to a spinor:
$ \"project_at\"(G, psi, a) : \"SpinorField\" $
This operator extracts the spinor component of the flow that is 'visible' at detector angle $a$ under kernel $G$. The detector angle is literally a parameter of the projection — not an intervention that causes collapse.")

define subsec_nonsep = ArxivSubsection("The Non-Separability Axiom",
"The foundational axiom for entanglement is:

*Axiom (Non-Separability).* There exist flows $psi_(A B)$ such that no decomposition into independent components reproduces the projection at all detector angles simultaneously. Formally: $psi_(A B)$ is not a product state.

In standard quantum mechanics, this corresponds to the statement that the singlet state $|psi^(-)angle = (|arrow.t arrow.b angle - |arrow.b arrow.t angle) \\/ sqrt(2)$ cannot be written as $|phi_A angle times.o |phi_B angle$. In POT, the statement is ontological: the entangled system is literally one wave in $cal(H)_(\"ont\")$, not two waves that happen to be correlated.

The crucial distinction: Bell's theorem assumes the *outcomes* at A and B can be described by independent functions $A(a, lambda)$ and $B(b, lambda)$. POT denies this — not because there is a faster-than-light signal between A and B, but because there is only one entity $psi_(A B)$ being projected at two spatial locations. There is no 'outcome at A' that is independent of the global projection structure.")

define subsec_measurement = ArxivSubsection("Measurement as Kernel Parameterization",
"In POT, measurement is the evaluation of a projection at a specific detector angle. The key operations are:

- $\"angle_between\"(a, b)$: the relative angle between two detector settings (symmetric, zero for identical settings)
- $\"spinor_inner\"(s_1, s_2)$: the inner product of two spinor fields (the 'overlap' of projected components)
- $\"spin_outcome\"(G, psi, a) = \"spinor_inner\"(\"project_at\"(G, psi, a), \"project_at\"(G, psi, a))$

The inner product is normalized: for the entangled state $psi_(A B)$, the spin outcome at any single detector is always 1 (unit probability of detecting the photon). This corresponds to the experimental fact that each photon is always detected — entanglement affects *correlations*, not detection probabilities.")

define sec_su2 = ArxivSection("SU(2) Symmetry and the Derivation of the Correlation Law",
"We now present the central theoretical advance of this paper: the derivation of the singlet correlation $E(a, b) = -cos(theta)$ from structural symmetry principles, rather than its postulation as an axiom. The derivation rests on five interlocking axioms (A–E below) together with kernel admissibility (Section 2), each of which has clear physical content and can be independently motivated. *Assumption ledger:* the empirical content is not encoded as a correlation formula; it is encoded as the claim that $cal(H)_(\"ont\")$ carries SU(2) symmetry and that this symmetry survives projection. The cosine law is downstream of representation theory, not an input.")

define subsec_ontic_su2 = ArxivSubsection("Axiom (A): SU(2) Symmetry in $cal(H)_(\"ont\")$",
"We posit that the ontological Hilbert space $cal(H)_(\"ont\")$ carries a unitary representation of SU(2). That is, there exists a group action $U(g) : \"Flow\" arrow.r \"Flow\"$ such that:

$ U(g compose h, psi) = U(g, U(h, psi)) quad \"and\" quad U(e, psi) = psi $

for all group elements $g, h in \"SU\"(2)$ and flows $psi in cal(H)_(\"ont\")$.

This is the core ontological commitment: the symmetry that we observe in angular momentum, spin, and polarization is not an emergent property of spacetime — it is a structure that *lives in* $cal(H)_(\"ont\")$ and is inherited by the observable world through projection. In the standard formulation of quantum mechanics, SU(2) acts on the Hilbert space of states; in POT, it acts on the deeper ontological space from which observable states are projected.")

define subsec_intertwiner = ArxivSubsection("Axiom (B): Symmetry Survival — The Projection as an Intertwiner",
"The critical question is: does SU(2) symmetry survive the projection $Pi : cal(H)_(\"ont\") arrow.r RR^4$? We axiomatize that it does, in the precise sense that $Pi$ is an *intertwiner*:

$ \"project_at\"(G, U(g, psi), g dot a) = R(g, \"project_at\"(G, psi, a)) $

where $R(g)$ is a representation of SU(2) on the spinor output space, and $g dot a$ denotes the induced SO(3) action of SU(2) on detector orientations. The induced action $g dot a$ is constrained by three properties:

1. *Group action*: $(g compose h) dot a = g dot (h dot a)$ and $e dot a = a$
2. *Isometry*: $theta(g dot a, g dot b) = theta(a, b)$ — relative angles are preserved. Without this constraint, the angle mapping could smuggle in the cosine law, recreating axiom E10 indirectly.
3. *Transitivity*: for any two angles $a, b$, there exists $g$ such that $g dot a = b$. This encodes that the angle space is $S^2$ (the 2-sphere), not some disconnected or lower-dimensional set.

The observable representation $R(g)$ acts on the 2-dimensional spinor space (basis ${e_(arrow.t), e_(arrow.b)}$) and is required to be *irreducible*: no proper nonzero subspace is invariant under all $R(g)$. By Schur's lemma, this forces $R$ to be the fundamental (spin-½) representation of SU(2), up to equivalence. This is the unique constraint that makes the correlation law $-cos(theta)$ rather than some other function of the angle.

Note what the intertwiner does *not* require. It does not require $Pi$ to be invertible — information can still be lost in projection. It only requires that $Pi$ commutes with the group action on whatever information survives. The projection can destroy detailed modal structure while preserving the rotational relationships between projected components.

The isometry constraint deserves emphasis: it is what prevents the cosine from sneaking into the formalism through the angle mapping. If $g dot a$ were an arbitrary function, one could define it to encode any desired correlation. By requiring that it preserves $theta(a, b)$, we ensure that $g dot a$ is genuinely a rotation on $S^2$, and that the angle dependence of the correlation emerges only through the representation theory of SU(2) — via the derivation in Section 4.6.")

define subsec_invariant_inner = ArxivSubsection("Axiom (C): Invariant Inner Products",
"Both the ontic inner product $chevron.l dot | dot chevron.r_(\"ont\")$ and the spinor inner product $chevron.l dot | dot chevron.r_(\"spinor\")$ are SU(2)-invariant:

$ chevron.l U(g, psi) | U(g, phi) chevron.r_(\"ont\") = chevron.l psi | phi chevron.r_(\"ont\") quad forall g in \"SU\"(2) $
$ chevron.l R(g, v) | R(g, w) chevron.r_(\"spinor\") = chevron.l v | w chevron.r_(\"spinor\") quad forall g in \"SU\"(2) $

These are standard unitarity conditions. Their role in the derivation is to ensure that SU(2) is not just a formal symmetry but a *metric* symmetry: it preserves the inner product, which is what connects angles to cosines. Without invariant inner products, SU(2) covariance would constrain the form of the correlation but could not determine it uniquely.")

define subsec_singlet_inv = ArxivSubsection("Axiom (D): Singlet Invariance",
"The entangled state $psi_(A B)$ is invariant under *diagonal* (simultaneous) SU(2) action:

$ U(g, psi_(A B)) = psi_(A B) quad forall g in \"SU\"(2) $

This is the POT formulation of 'total spin zero.' In standard quantum mechanics, the singlet state satisfies $(sigma_A + sigma_B) | psi^(-) chevron.r = 0$. In POT, the statement is ontological: the entangled flow is a rotationally invariant configuration in $cal(H)_(\"ont\")$. It has no preferred direction — any directional information emerges only through the projection.")

define subsec_born = ArxivSubsection("Axiom (E): Born-Type Modal Visibility",
"The probability of a measurement outcome — and therefore the correlation — is governed by the squared norm of the projected component:

$ \"spin_outcome\"(G, psi, a) = chevron.l \"project_at\"(G, psi, a) | \"project_at\"(G, psi, a) chevron.r $

This is the Born rule reinterpreted: not a postulate about probabilities of 'measurement outcomes' on 'quantum states,' but a structural fact about *modal visibility*. The fraction of modal content that survives projection into detector angle $a$ is the squared norm of the projected spinor. The inner product is normalized for the singlet: each single-detector outcome has unit probability, because each photon is always detected.")

define subsec_derivation = ArxivSubsection("Derivation: From SU(2) to −cos(θ)",
"We now sketch the derivation path, emphasizing where each axiom enters and where the cosine specifically comes from:

1. *Singlet invariance* (D): $psi_(A B)$ is unchanged under diagonal SU(2).
2. *Intertwiner* (B): Projected spinors transform covariantly: $\"project_at\"(G, U(g, psi), g dot a) = R(g, \"project_at\"(G, psi, a))$.
3. *Combined*: Since $U(g, psi_(A B)) = psi_(A B)$, we have $\"project_at\"(G, psi_(A B), g dot a) = R(g, \"project_at\"(G, psi_(A B), a))$. The projected components transform under $R(g)$ when we rotate the detector.
4. *Isometry* (B): The angle action preserves $theta(a, b)$. Together with the invariant inner product (C), this forces $E(a, b)$ to depend only on $theta = theta(a, b)$, not on the absolute orientations of $a$ and $b$.
5. *Transitivity* (B): SU(2) acts transitively on detector angles, so $E$ is determined by its values on a single orbit — the function $E(theta)$ for $theta in [0, pi]$.
6. *2D irreducibility* (SpinorBasis + RepIrreducibility): $R$ is the fundamental spin-½ representation. On a 2D irreducible unitary representation of SU(2), the unique (up to normalization) $R$-invariant bilinear form on projected spinors at relative angle $theta$ is $cos(theta)$. This is where the cosine specifically enters — it is a representation-theoretic fact about spin-½, not an assumption about the physics. If $R$ were spin-1 (3D irreducible), the correlation would involve $P_1(cos theta) = cos theta$; if spin-$j$, it would involve Legendre polynomial $P_j$. The 2D irreducibility uniquely selects $cos(theta)$.
7. *Boundary condition*: Perfect anticorrelation at $theta = 0$ (from singlet invariance: the singlet pairs opposite spins) fixes the sign: $E(a, b) = -cos(theta)$.

No step in this derivation assumes the correlation formula. The cosine emerges from the representation theory of SU(2) on a 2D space, constrained by the intertwiner (with isometry), the invariant inner product, and singlet invariance. This is standard mathematical physics — Schur's lemma and the Wigner-Eckart theorem — but grounded in POT's ontology rather than the standard Hilbert-space formalism.")

define subsec_concrete_kernel = ArxivSubsection("The Concrete Measurement Kernel",
"In the companion paper on rotation curves, we identified the concrete gravitational kernel as the logarithmic Green's function $K(r) prop ln(1 + r \\/ R_c)$, arising from the projection of the 4D Laplacian Green's function to 3D. Here we identify the concrete measurement kernel $K_(\"rep\")$ for photon polarization.

For a spin-½ system, the $K_(\"rep\")$ sector acts on the $CC^2$ spinor representation. The singlet state in Hont corresponds to:
$ psi_(A B) = (| arrow.t arrow.b chevron.r - | arrow.b arrow.t chevron.r) \\/ sqrt(2) $

The projection at detector angle $theta$ selects the spinor component:
$ | theta chevron.r = cos(theta \\/ 2) | arrow.t chevron.r + sin(theta \\/ 2) | arrow.b chevron.r $

In POT language, $\"project_at\"(G, psi_(A B), a)$ evaluates the $K_(\"rep\")$ kernel at angle $a$, extracting the modal component visible to that detector orientation. The correlation is then the spinor inner product of projections at two angles:
$ E(a, b) = chevron.l psi_(A B) | (sigma dot hat(a)) times.o (sigma dot hat(b)) | psi_(A B) chevron.r = -cos(theta) $
where $sigma$ are the Pauli matrices and $hat(a)$, $hat(b)$ are unit vectors along the detector axes.

This is the same formula used in standard quantum mechanics. The difference is interpretive: in QM, the $-cos(theta)$ is a probabilistic prediction about measurement outcomes on separate particles. In POT, it is a geometric property of a single wave projected at two angles — the spinor inner product of two views of the same modal structure. The numerical calculations in Section 5 evaluate this formula directly.")

define subsec_correlation = ArxivSubsection("The Singlet Correlation Function",
"*Definition.* The correlation between measurements at angles $a$ and $b$ on the entangled state $psi_(A B)$ is
$ E(a, b) = \"spinor_inner\"(\"project_at\"(G, psi_(A B), a), thin \"project_at\"(G, psi_(A B), b)) $

*Theorem 1 (Singlet Correlation — Derived).* For any admissible kernel $G$:
$ E(a, b) = -cos(theta) $
where $theta = \"angle_between\"(a, b)$.

*Proof.* By singlet invariance (D), $U(g, psi_(A B)) = psi_(A B)$. By the intertwiner (B), projected spinors transform covariantly under $R(g)$. By the isometry constraint on the angle action (B) and invariance of the spinor inner product (C), $E(a, b)$ depends only on the relative angle $theta(a, b)$. By 2D irreducibility (SpinorBasis + RepIrreducibility), the unique $R$-invariant function of $theta$ on the fundamental SU(2) representation is $cos(theta)$. The sign is fixed by perfect anticorrelation at $theta = 0$. No step assumes the formula; it follows from the SU(2) structure. $square$

This is the same $-cos(theta)$ predicted by quantum mechanics for photon polarization entanglement. The critical difference from our previous treatment: it is not asserted as an axiom (as in theory v1) but *derived* from the SU(2) symmetry structure of $cal(H)_(\"ont\")$. The assumption has moved from the formula to the symmetry — a far more natural starting point for physics.")

In POT, this is trivial — the same wave projected at the same angle from two spatial locations gives complementary components by the singlet structure. There is nothing to 'transmit'; the anticorrelation is a geometric fact about the wave's symmetry.")

"*Bell's Inequality (CHSH form).* For any *product state* $psi$ (separable into independent components at A and B):
$ |E(a, b) - E(a, c)| <= 1 + E(b, c) $

*Theorem 2.* This inequality is verified by Z3 for all admissible kernels and all product states. The proof uses the factorization property of product states: because the outcomes at A and B are described by independent projection functions, the correlations are bounded by the triangle inequality in the space of independent random variables.

*Theorem 3 (Bell Violation).* For the entangled state $psi_(A B)$, there exist detector angles $a, b, c$ such that
$ |E(a, b) - E(a, c)| > 1 + E(b, c) $

*Proof.* The standard choice $a = 0$, $b = pi \\/ 4$, $c = pi \\/ 2$ gives:
$ E(a, b) = -cos(pi \\/ 4) = -sqrt(2) \\/ 2 approx -0.707 $
$ E(a, c) = -cos(pi \\/ 2) = 0 $
$ E(b, c) = -cos(pi \\/ 4) = -sqrt(2) \\/ 2 approx -0.707 $
Then: $|E(a,b) - E(a,c)| = sqrt(2) \\/ 2 approx 0.707$ while $1 + E(b,c) = 1 - sqrt(2) \\/ 2 approx 0.293$.
Since $0.707 > 0.293$, the inequality is violated. $square$

*Theorem 4 (Legitimacy).* The violation is legitimate because $psi_(A B)$ is not a product state: $not \"is_product_state\"(psi_(A B))$ for all admissible kernels.

Bell's theorem does not apply to POT because its derivation requires separability, which POT denies. The violation is not evidence of non-locality — it is evidence that entangled particles are not independently describable systems.")

With $E(a,b) = -cos(theta)$:

We now show that POT passes this test.")

"The GHZ state is a maximally entangled three-particle state:
$ | \"GHZ\" chevron.r = (| arrow.t arrow.t arrow.t chevron.r + | arrow.b arrow.b arrow.b chevron.r) \\/ sqrt(2) $

When measured in the Pauli $X$ and $Y$ bases, the GHZ state produces deterministic parity constraints on the triple product of measurement outcomes $o_A, o_B, o_C in {+1, -1}$:
$ o_A^((X)) o_B^((X)) o_C^((X)) = +1 quad quad \"(all \" X \")\" $

These are not probabilistic bounds — they are exact eigenvalue relations verified in every run of the experiment.

"A *noncontextual* hidden-variable theory assigns definite values to each measurement *independently of which other measurements are performed simultaneously*. That is, particle A's X-outcome $x_A$ is the same whether B and C are measured in X or in Y.

Under this assumption, we introduce six pre-assigned variables $x_A, y_A, x_B, y_B, x_C, y_C in {+1, -1}$ and substitute into the four parity equations:
$ x_A x_B x_C = +1 $
$ x_A y_B y_C = -1 $
$ y_A x_B y_C = -1 $
$ y_A y_B x_C = -1 $

Taking the product of the last three equations:
$ (x_A y_B y_C)(y_A x_B y_C)(y_A y_B x_C) = (-1)^3 = -1 $

Since $y_A^2 = y_B^2 = y_C^2 = 1$, the left side simplifies to $x_A x_B x_C = -1$.

But the first equation requires $x_A x_B x_C = +1$. This is a direct algebraic contradiction.

*Theorem 5 (GHZ No-Go).* No assignment of context-independent $plus.minus 1$ values to X and Y measurements at three sites can satisfy all four GHZ parity constraints simultaneously. Verified by Z3 (UNSAT).")

define subsec_ghz_pot = ArxivSubsection("POT Satisfies the GHZ Constraints",
"POT avoids the contradiction because measurement outcomes are *not* pre-assigned context-independent values. In POT, the outcome at each site is a function of the measurement context — the full specification of which bases are used at all three detectors:
$ o_A(\"ctx\"), thin o_B(\"ctx\"), thin o_C(\"ctx\") quad \"where ctx\" in {X X X, thin X Y Y, thin Y X Y, thin Y Y X} $

The outcome $o_A(X X X)$ (A measured in X while B and C are also in X) need not equal $o_A(X Y Y)$ (A measured in X while B and C are in Y). The measurement basis at distant sites is part of the projection operator — it determines which modal components are selected.

*Theorem 6 (POT Contextual Consistency).* There exist context-dependent outcome functions $o_A(\"ctx\"), o_B(\"ctx\"), o_C(\"ctx\")$ with values in ${plus.minus 1}$ that satisfy all four GHZ parity constraints simultaneously. Verified by Z3 (SAT).

This is not a loophole — it is the core ontological claim of POT. The GHZ state $psi_(\"GHZ\")$ is a single non-separable flow in $cal(H)_(\"ont\")$, and the projection operator $K_(\"rep\")$ at each site depends on the full measurement context. Different contexts select different modal components, producing different outcomes. The correlations are properties of the global mode, not signals between particles.

To be precise about what this result does and does not establish: Theorem 5 rules out all theories that assign context-independent $plus.minus 1$ values to X and Y at each site. Theorem 6 demonstrates that POT is not in the ruled-out class — its outcomes are context-dependent by construction. This does not 'solve' GHZ; it shows POT is compatible with the GHZ phenomenon, which is a necessary condition for any viable theory of quantum correlations.")

"A natural objection to any theory with ontic contextuality is: if measurement outcomes at A depend on the global context (including B's setting), doesn't that allow faster-than-light communication? We now prove that the answer is no. Crucially, our proof does not assume factorization, product states, or explicit density matrix machinery — it relies only on singlet invariance, invariant inner products, and the irreducibility of the spin-½ representation.")

define subsec_bipartite = ArxivSubsection("Bipartite Measurement Structure",
"To state no-signaling non-trivially, we introduce a bipartite measurement framework grounded in the projection architecture. The construction has three layers:

*Layer 1: Bipartite amplitudes.* We define the amplitude $cal(A)(G, psi, a, s_A, b, s_B)$ for detecting spinor state $s_A$ at angle $a$ and spinor state $s_B$ at angle $b$. This amplitude is constrained by SU(2) covariance:
$ cal(A)(G, U(g, psi), g dot a, R(g, s_A), g dot b, R(g, s_B)) = cal(A)(G, psi, a, s_A, b, s_B) $
and by a completeness relation connecting bipartite amplitudes to single-site projections:
$ sum_(s_B in {e_(arrow.t), e_(arrow.b)}) |cal(A)(G, psi, a, s_A, b, s_B)|^2 = |chevron.l \"project_at\"(G, psi, a) | s_A chevron.r|^2 $

The direction is critical: amplitudes are upstream, probabilities are downstream.

*Layer 2: Joint probabilities from amplitudes.* Joint probabilities are *defined* from amplitudes via the bipartite Born rule:
$ P(o_A, o_B | a, b) = |cal(A)(G, psi_(A B), a, s_(o_A), b, s_(o_B))|^2 $

These are not free operations — they inherit all constraints from the amplitude structure. The four joint probabilities satisfy normalization:
$ P(+,+|a,b) + P(+,-|a,b) + P(-,+|a,b) + P(-,-|a,b) = 1 $

The correlation is recovered downstream:
$ E(a, b) = P(+,+) - P(+,-) - P(-,+) + P(-,-) $

*Layer 3: Marginals by partial trace.* The marginal at A is obtained by genuinely summing over B's outcomes:
$ P(o_A = +1 | a, b) = P(+,+ | a,b) + P(+,- | a,b) $

By the completeness relation, this sum collapses to a single-site quantity:
$ P(+1_A | a, b) = |chevron.l \"project_at\"(G, psi_(A B), a) | e_(arrow.t) chevron.r|^2 $

Note that the right-hand side does not mention $b$ — but this is not a definitional trick. It is a *consequence* of completeness summing over a complete basis at B. The joint probabilities on the left each depend on $b$ through the bipartite amplitudes; their sum happens to be $b$-independent because of the structure of the partial trace.")

define subsec_nosignaling_thm = ArxivSubsection("The No-Signaling Theorem",
"*Lemma (Maximally Mixed Reduced State).* Let $psi_(A B)$ be SU(2)-invariant under diagonal action (Axiom D: $U(g, psi_(A B)) = psi_(A B)$). Let $R$ be the fundamental 2D irreducible representation of SU(2) on the spinor space (SpinorBasis + RepIrreducibility). Then the reduced state at each wing is the maximally mixed state $I \\/ 2$.

*Proof.* By singlet invariance, the global state is unchanged under simultaneous SU(2) rotation. The reduced state at A, obtained by tracing over B, must therefore be SU(2)-invariant as well: for any $g in \"SU\"(2)$, $R(g) rho_A R(g)^(dagger) = rho_A$. By Schur's lemma, the only operator on a 2D irreducible representation that commutes with all $R(g)$ is proportional to the identity. Combined with $\"Tr\"(rho_A) = 1$, this gives $rho_A = I \\/ 2$. $square$

*Consequence:* $P(o_A = plus.minus 1 | a, b) = 1 \\/ 2$ for all $a$ and all $b$.

*Theorem 7 (No-Signaling).* For any admissible kernel $G$ and any detector angles $a$, $b_1$, $b_2$:
$ P(o_A | a, b_1) = P(o_A | a, b_2) = 1 \\/  2 $

*Proof.* By the maximally mixed lemma, the marginal at A equals $1 \\/ 2$ regardless of the value of $b$. This follows from:
- Singlet invariance (Axiom D) — no factorization assumed
- Invariant inner product (Axiom C) — no explicit density matrices needed
- 2D irreducibility (SpinorBasis + RepIrreducibility) — Schur's lemma applies
- Linearity of the projection (kernel admissibility) — the partial trace is well-defined $square$

The physical content: POT is *ontically contextual* — the underlying modal structure is global, and the joint probabilities $P(o_A, o_B | a, b)$ genuinely depend on both $a$ and $b$. But POT is *operationally local* — the marginal $sum_(o_B) P(o_A, o_B | a, b) = 1 \\/ 2$ is independent of $b$. No experiment at A can detect what setting B has chosen. The contextuality is a property of the ontic level (the pre-projected wave), not of the epistemic level (the observable marginal statistics).

This achieves the key desideratum: *contextual ontology + operational locality*.")

define subsec_locality = ArxivSubsection("Locality Preserved",
"POT preserves locality in the following precise sense: no signal or influence travels from detector A to detector B. The measurement at A is a local evaluation of the projection $\"project_at\"(G, psi_(A B), a)$, and the measurement at B is a local evaluation $\"project_at\"(G, psi_(A B), b)$. These are the *same* projection operator applied to the *same* wave at different spatial coordinates — analogous to reading two nodes of a single vibrating string. The string doesn't 'send a signal' from one node to the other; the correlation is a structural property of the string itself.

Bell's theorem excludes theories where the outcomes $A(a, lambda)$ and $B(b, lambda)$ are *independent functions* sharing only a hidden variable $lambda$. POT evades this by denying that A and B are independent functions — they are evaluations of a single function $\"project_at\"(G, psi, dot)$ at different arguments.")

define subsec_born_rule = ArxivSubsection("The Born Rule as Modal Visibility",
"In standard quantum mechanics, the Born rule $P = |chevron.l phi | psi chevron.r|^2$ is a postulate. In POT, it is Axiom (E) — the Born-type modal visibility rule — which states that the probability of an outcome is the *fraction of the modal content that survives projection* into the detector's measurement basis. The spinor inner product $\"spinor_inner\"(\"project_at\"(G, psi, a), \"project_at\"(G, psi, b))$ is exactly this overlap.

Combined with the SU(2) covariance axioms (A)–(D), this rule is sufficient to derive the complete correlation function. In v1 of this theory, the $-cos(theta)$ formula was asserted directly (axiom E10); in v2, it is a consequence of modal visibility plus the symmetry structure of $cal(H)_(\"ont\")$. The Born rule is the bridge between geometric symmetry and observable statistics.

This reinterpretation has a concrete consequence: 'collapse' is not a physical process but a change in which modal components are being projected. When an experimenter rotates a polarizer, they change the projection kernel $K_(\"rep\")$, not the wave $psi_(A B)$. The wave continues to exist in full in $cal(H)_(\"ont\")$; only our view of it changes.")

- The *gravitational sector* uses the elliptic limit of $K_(\"dyn\")$ (static potentials, mass residues) with scalar $K_(\"rep\")$ — producing flat rotation curves via logarithmic coherence.
- The *measurement sector* uses the hyperbolic limit of $K_(\"dyn\")$ (causal propagation) with matrix-valued $K_(\"rep\")$ (acting on spin-½ representations) — producing the $-cos(theta)$ correlation.

What is *proved* in this paper and its companion: the kernel composition axiom ensures that the combined operator remains admissible, so all foundational guarantees (linearity, nullspace closure, projective equivalence) carry through to both sectors simultaneously. Both sectors share admissibility under composition — this is a theorem.

What remains *conjectural*: whether a single non-trivial structural constraint forces both the logarithmic Green's function of the gravitational sector and the SU(2) inner-product structure of the measurement sector. The factorization $K = K_(\"univ\") dot K_(\"dyn\") dot K_(\"rep\")$ is compatible with both, but the deeper question — whether admissibility *uniquely selects* these two sectors — is open. We regard this as a productive research direction, not a claim of this paper.")

- The entangled state $psi_(A B)$ is a photon pair produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC), in the singlet-like state $|H V chevron.r - |V H chevron.r$.
- The detector angles $a, b$ are polarizer orientations.
- The correlation $E(a, b) = -cos(2 theta)$ for polarization. The factor of 2 arises because linear polarization angles on the Poincaré sphere cover $S^2$ with a $2:1$ map ($theta_(\"pol\") arrow.r 2 theta_(\"pol\")$ on the Bloch sphere). Our spin-½ formalism produces $-cos(theta)$ directly; the structures are identical up to this geometric rescaling.

The CHSH inequality $S <= 2$ has been violated in every precision experiment since 1972, with the most stringent loophole-free tests confirming $S = 2.83 plus.minus 0.02$ — matching Tsirelson's bound $2sqrt(2)$ to experimental precision. Our derivation reproduces this value as a theorem.")

define subsec_limitations = ArxivSubsection("What This Paper Does Not Do",
"We wish to be explicit about a deliberate methodological choice: this paper does not postulate a Lagrangian, a Hamiltonian, or any dynamical equation governing the modal flow in $cal(H)_(\"ont\")$. It does not specify the concrete codomain structure (whether $CC^2$, a Clifford module, or a Lie group representation) beyond what is required for the projection axioms. It does not describe the internal dynamics of the pre-observable space.

This omission is deliberate, not accidental. POT's foundational principle of *epistemic constraint* holds that we can only make rigorous claims about what survives projection. The internal structure of $cal(H)_(\"ont\")$ is, by definition, not directly observable — it is the space *from which* observables are projected. Postulating specific dynamics in Hont would be speculation dressed as theory.

What we *do* claim is the following: the full axiom set (see Appendix) is *satisfiable* — there exist mathematical structures that realize these axioms. Standard quantum mechanics itself provides the existence proof: the singlet state in $CC^2 times.o CC^2$ with the standard inner product is a concrete model satisfying every axiom in this paper. The correlation $-cos(theta)$ is computed, not assumed.

There is a deeper reason for this restraint, one that goes beyond methodology. The projection $Pi$ is many-to-one and non-invertible — information is irreversibly lost. The theorist, the experimental apparatus, and any reasoning tool used to construct the theory are themselves outputs of this projection. We exist *inside* the projection. Therefore, any claim to know the complete Lagrangian of $cal(H)_(\"ont\")$ would require information that the projection provably destroyed. A specific Lagrangian would be one of infinitely many consistent with the same projected observables, and we would have no empirical basis to choose among them.

The axioms in this paper represent the strongest claims that can be made from within the projection: they constrain the class of possible dynamics in $cal(H)_(\"ont\")$ without specifying a unique one. Everything beyond these constraints lies in the nullspace of $Pi$ — epistemically inaccessible by construction. This is not a temporary limitation to be overcome by cleverer mathematics; it is a structural feature of any theory built on irreversible projection.

We consider this an honest position. Many successful frameworks in physics begin with kinematic constraints before dynamics are fully specified — the S-matrix program, topological quantum field theory, and the axiomatic approach to quantum mechanics itself all follow this pattern.")

define subsec_sanity = ArxivSubsection("Model-Theoretic Sanity Checks",
"Because our derivations rely on an SMT solver (Z3) to verify satisfiability and consistency, we must ensure that the axiom set does not admit degenerate models that trivialize the results. We explicitly address three potential failure modes:

*1. Degenerate angle models.* If $\"angle_between\"(a, b) equiv 0$ for all $a, b$, then $E(a, b) = -cos(0) = -1$ trivially, and Bell violation would be vacuous. We prevent this with the non-degeneracy axiom: $exists(a, b). theta(a, b) > 0$, the metric axiom $theta(a, b) = 0 arrow.r.double a = b$, and the range constraint $0 <= theta(a, b) <= pi$. These ensure the angle space is a genuine metric space homeomorphic to $S^2$ (enforced further by the transitive SU(2) action).

*2. Observable representation drift.* If the spinor space were allowed to be 3-dimensional or higher, the representation $R$ could be spin-1 or higher, yielding a different correlation function (Legendre polynomials rather than bare cosine). We fix the representation to the fundamental 2D irrep by: (a) providing an explicit orthonormal basis ${e_(arrow.t), e_(arrow.b)}$, (b) requiring that every spinor is a linear combination of these two basis elements (the spanning axiom), and (c) requiring irreducibility of $R$ in the Schur sense (no 1D invariant subspace). These three constraints together pin the observable sector to spin-½.

*3. Anti-smuggling.* The cosine law must emerge from the representation theory of SU(2), not from a rigged angle parameterization. The isometry axiom $theta(g dot a, g dot b) = theta(a, b)$ ensures that the SU(2) angle action is a genuine rotation on $S^2$, not an arbitrary reparameterization that could encode the correlation formula. The Born-type rule (Axiom E) is strictly the quadratic form $P(a) = ||Pi_a(psi)||^2$ — it encodes no angle dependence. And the bipartite amplitudes are constrained by SU(2) covariance, with joint probabilities defined downstream via the bipartite Born rule.

We note an important methodological clarification: we are *not* deriving SU(2) from kernel admissibility. We are deriving *correlations* from *symmetry survival*. The SU(2) structure of $cal(H)_(\"ont\")$ is an ontological posit — the claim that angular momentum symmetry is a feature of the pre-observable space, not an emergent property of spacetime. The admissible kernel framework governs how this symmetry *projects* to observable physics. These are complementary, not derivational.")

// =============================================================================
// Section 9: Conclusion
// =============================================================================

define sec_conclusion = ArxivSection("Conclusion",
"We have shown that Bell inequality violation, GHZ contextuality, and operational no-signaling are theorems of Projected Ontology Theory — logical consequences of SU(2) symmetry in $cal(H)_(\"ont\")$, non-separability, and the projection structure.

The central advance of this paper over our previous treatment is the *derivation* of the singlet correlation $E(a,b) = -cos(theta)$ from deeper structural principles. In our initial formalization (theory v1), this formula was asserted as axiom E10 — a direct postulation of the correlation function. In the present work (theory v2), it is derived from five axioms: (A) SU(2) symmetry in $cal(H)_(\"ont\")$, (B) symmetry survival through projection (the intertwiner property), (C) invariant inner products, (D) singlet invariance under diagonal SU(2), and (E) the Born-type modal visibility rule. The cosine law follows from the representation theory of SU(2) applied to the spin-½ sector — standard mathematics, but grounded in a new ontology.

This matters because it addresses the most natural criticism of the previous version: 'You just assumed the answer.' Now the answer follows from symmetry, and the symmetry has clear physical content — it is the claim that $cal(H)_(\"ont\")$ carries the same angular momentum structure that manifests in observable physics. The assumption has moved from formula to structure.

The no-signaling theorem (Theorem 7) addresses the equally natural concern about contextuality: if outcomes depend on the global measurement context, can this be exploited for faster-than-light communication? No — the singlet's SU(2) invariance ensures that marginal statistics at each detector are independent of the remote setting. POT is ontically contextual but operationally local.

The GHZ result strengthens the Bell analysis decisively. Where Bell's theorem is statistical, the GHZ argument is deterministic: a single algebraic contradiction eliminates all noncontextual hidden-variable theories. POT survives this test because its measurement outcomes are context-dependent by construction.

Structurally, the measurement kernel and the gravitational kernel are both sectors of the factorized operator $K = K_(\"univ\") dot K_(\"dyn\") dot K_(\"rep\")$, sharing the same admissibility axioms. This paper and its companion prove that admissibility under composition carries foundational guarantees to both sectors. Whether a deeper structural constraint *forces* both the gravitational and measurement sectors remains an open and productive question — not a claim of the present work.

We emphasize what this paper is and is not. It is a formally verified, internally consistent ontological reinterpretation of quantum entanglement, grounded in SU(2) symmetry survival through projection. It reproduces quantum mechanical predictions exactly — it does not modify them. The question of whether POT predicts deviations from standard QM at some scale, or whether it derives the SU(2) structure itself from deeper principles, remains open. The present contribution is the demonstration that the full entanglement phenomenology (singlet correlation, Bell violation, Tsirelson's bound, GHZ parity constraints, and no-signaling) can be machine-verified from explicit structural axioms — with the assumption moved from correlation formula to ontic symmetry.

Extending to $N$-particle systems, quantum teleportation protocols, and other gauge symmetries (SU(3), Lorentz) remain open directions.

define appendix_axioms = ArxivSection("Appendix: Complete Axiom Set (v2)",
"Below is the complete axiom set used in this paper, formatted for reference. Axioms A1–A4 are shared with the rotation curves paper. Axioms E1–E6 cover kernel factorization and non-separability. Axioms S1–S12 are the new SU(2) symmetry axioms that *replace* the old E10 (direct assertion of $-cos(theta)$). Axioms M1–M2 cover measurement geometry. Axiom B1 is the Born-type modal visibility rule. The correlation law $E(a,b) = -cos(theta)$ is now derived, not assumed. Axioms N1–N3 establish no-signaling.
