# Hilbert Ontology (HONT)

**Hilbert Ontology** combines metaphysical clarity with Hilbert-space-inspired mathematical structure to formalize ontological reasoning.

---

## Core Principles

### Hilbert-Space Structure
Ontology expressed through structures inspired by Hilbert spaces:
- Inner products
- Projection operators
- Orthogonal decompositions
- Complete metric spaces

### Modal Framework
Integration with modal logic and possible worlds semantics.

### Formal Rigor
Mathematical precision applied to ontological questions.

---

## Mathematical Foundations

HONT provides the mathematical substrate for:
- State spaces
- Transformations
- Observables
- Projections
- Modal operators

These become computable operations in Kleis.

## Relationship to POT

HONT provides the mathematical structure while **Projected Ontology Theory (POT)** provides the modal and projection-based framework:

- **HONT:** Mathematical structure (Hilbert spaces, operators, metrics)
- **POT:** Modal operations (projection, residue, bifurcation)

Together they form a complete ontological framework.

## Applications in Kleis

Kleis operations inspired by HONT:
- Inner products: `⟨u, v⟩`
- Bra-ket notation: `|ψ⟩`, `⟨φ|`
- Projection operators
- Operator algebra (commutators, anticommutators)
- Spectral decompositions

## Future Directions

### Formal Type System
Type-aware evaluation respecting:
- Vector spaces
- Operator domains
- Modal contexts
- Proof obligations

### Self-Hosting
Kleis will eventually express HONT axioms in its own language, becoming a self-hosted formal system.

### Package Distribution
HONT-based algebras distributed as `.kleis` packages with:
- Operations
- Glyphs
- Semantic rules
- Proof annotations
