# Vision: Kleis as a Living Framework for Mathematical Structure

## Core Idea

A mathematician defines a new algebra — gives it notation, glyphs, rendering templates, and laws —  
and **Kleis understands it**, applies it, renders it, and shares it.

This transforms mathematics from static notation into **living, executable structure**.

## The Cycle of Formal Power in Kleis

### 1. Definition
```kleis
object Algebra A { op1, op2 }
operation op1 : (A, A) -> A
operation op2 : A -> Scalar
```

### 2. Glyph Binding
```kleis
template op1 {glyph: "⨁", latex: "{left} \oplus {right}", unicode: "{left} ⨁ {right}"}
template op2 {glyph: "|·|", latex: "\|{arg}\|", unicode: "|{arg}|"}
```

### 3. Law Assertion
```kleis
assert op1(op1(x, y), z) == op1(x, op1(y, z))
```

### 4. Package Distribution
Mathematician packages the algebra into a distributable module:
```
kleis-pkg-algebra-r47
```

### 5. Reuse and Visualization
Another author imports the algebra:
```kleis
import algebra-r47
define total = op1(a, op1(b, c))
render total
```

Kleis renders and evaluates it using the exact templates and rules.

## Strategic Outcome

- Notation becomes executable.
- Algebra becomes shareable.
- Laws become computable.
- Visual rendering is tied to symbolic semantics.
- New mathematics is born **inside a formal, visual, extensible language**.

## Formal Vision Statement

> Kleis will allow new mathematical systems to be defined, visualized, validated, and reused —  
> not just through paper, but through structure.  
> Notation becomes executable.  
> Algebra becomes live.  
> Symbolic reasoning becomes a shared, visual medium.

---

## Future Implications

- Math is no longer tied to paper and ink; it becomes composable, inspectable, live.
- Authors can define visual mathematics as software packages.
- Kleis becomes the "Git and VSCode for symbolic thought."

This is the foundational idea for a shared, visual, executable mathematics platform for the 21st century.
