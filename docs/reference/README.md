### HARD_PROBLEMS_AHEAD.md ⭐

> **🏛️ HISTORICALLY SIGNIFICANT** (Dec 2025)
>
> **This is where Kleis crystallized as a language.**
>
> After the structural editor was complete, this document confronted what
> Kleis *really* needed to become. The problems listed became the roadmap.
> Most have now been solved - what was estimated at "4-5 years" took months.

**A testament to honest assessment followed by determined execution.**
