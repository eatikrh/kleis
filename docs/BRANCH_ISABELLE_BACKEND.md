# Isabelle Backend (feature/isabelle-solver-backend) — Hibernation

- Purpose: experiment with an Isabelle/HOL solver backend for Kleis.
- Status: work paused/hibernating; requires strong Isabelle/Isar/ML expertise to continue.
- Branch: `feature/isabelle-solver-backend` (pushed to origin).
- Notes:
  - Backend and examples are in this branch; not integrated as a practical default solver.
  - Further progress should be done by someone comfortable working directly in the Isabelle environment.
