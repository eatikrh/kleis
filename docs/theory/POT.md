# Projected Ontology Theory (POT)

**Projected Ontology Theory** is a modal ontological framework that formalizes concepts like projection, residue, bifurcation, and emergent phenomena within Hilbert-space-inspired structures.

---

## Core Concepts

### Projection
Modal flow and projection mechanics as fundamental ontological operations.

### Residue
The remainder or trace left after projection operations.

### Modal Coherence
Coherence across modal spaces and transformations.

### Emergent Phenomena
How structure emerges from projection and modal interactions.

## Formalization in Kleis

POT provides the metaphysical foundations that Kleis formalizes computationally. Kleis operations like:
- Projection operators
- Modal transformations
- Residue calculation
- Bifurcation points

are grounded in POT principles.

## Relationship to HONT

POT works alongside **Hilbert Ontology (HONT)** to provide:
- **POT:** Modal and projection-based framework
- **HONT:** Hilbert-space-inspired mathematical structure

Together they form the metaphysical and mathematical foundation of Kleis.

## Future Work

- Formal type system for modal operations
- Proof obligations for projection validity
- Visualization of modal flows
- Package system for distributing POT-based algebras
