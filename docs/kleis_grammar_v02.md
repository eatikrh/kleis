# Kleis Grammar v0.2 – First Design Document (Updated)

## Introduction
Kleis Grammar (v0.2) is a formal, minimalistic syntax and structural framework for representing advanced mathematical and physical objects such as Monads, Spinors, Functors, and other compositional structures. The grammar prioritizes:
- Composability
- Clarity
- Explicit typing
- Minimal yet extensible syntax
- Symbolic manipulation before numeric evaluation
- Context-sensitive treatment of equality

This document establishes the foundational principles for Kleis Grammar to enable rapid prototyping of concrete examples in subsequent sessions.

## Core Principles
1. **Atomic Units:** Every object is described as an atomic unit with clear typing.
2. **Composition over Mutation:** Transformation occurs by composition, not mutation.
3. **Type Propagation:** Every composition propagates types explicitly unless otherwise overridden.
4. **Minimal Overhead:** Syntax should avoid verbosity while remaining explicit.
5. **Extensibility:** Future extensions (categories, operators, duals, higher-order objects) should integrate naturally.
6. **Symbolic Scalars:** Scalars are symbolic by default. Numeric binding happens only for evaluation.
7. **Typed Equalities:** Equality distinctions are made explicit (definition, algebraic equality, structural equivalence, approximation).

## Basic Structural Elements

### Objects
```
object <Type> <Name>
```
Examples:
```
object Monad M
object Spinor S
object Functor F
```

Optional initial properties:
```
object Monad M { unit, bind }
object Spinor S { dimension=2 }
```

### Morphisms (Arrows)
```
narrow <Source> -> <Target> [<Label>]
```
Examples:
```
narrow M -> M [bind]
narrow S -> S [rotation]
narrow F(A) -> B [map]
```

### Composition
```
A >> B >> C
```
Example:
```
M >> bind >> M
```

### Type Families and Parametric Types
```
object Functor[C,D] F
```

### Annotations
```
object Monad M @{laws = [left_identity, right_identity, associativity]}
narrow M -> M [bind] @{associative}
```

### Scalars and Constants
```
const Pi
const G_c
const FourPi = 4 * Pi
```

### Operations
```
operation <Name> : (<InputTypes>) -> <OutputType>
```
Examples:
```
operation grad : Potential -> Field
operation surface_integral : Field -> Scalar
operation scalar_multiply : (Scalar, Object) -> Object
operation scalar_divide : (Object, Scalar) -> Object
```

### Equality Types

| Syntax              | Meaning                          |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| `define A = B`      | Definition (by fiat)             |
| `assert A == B`     | Algebraic equality               |
| `equiv A ~ B`       | Structural equivalence           |
| `approx A ≈ B`      | Approximate (numerical) equality |

## Example (Preview)
```
object Monad M { unit, bind }
object Functor[C,D] F
narrow M -> M [bind] @{associative}
narrow F(A) -> F(B) [map]
const Pi
const G_c
const FourPi = 4 * Pi
operation grad : Potential -> Field
operation surface_integral : Field -> Scalar
operation scalar_multiply : (Scalar, Object) -> Object
operation scalar_divide : (Object, Scalar) -> Object
```

## Initial Target Objects for Representation
- **Monad**: unit, bind, associativity laws
- **Functor**: map, identity preservation, composition preservation
- **Spinor**: transformation under SU(2), dimension, conjugation
- **General Morphisms**: Composition chaining, type consistency
- **Mass-Residue Relationship**: Surface integral leading to symbolic mass definition

## Next Steps
- Define concrete sample syntax for Monad, Spinor, Functor.
- Specify how "laws" (such as associativity) are represented and verified syntactically.
- Explore optional "proof" structures.
- Formalize the Mass-Residue derivation.
- Plan for future handling of duals, higher categories, adjunctions.

## Further work
- Formal Kleis DSL sketch
- Wrapping rendering pipeline
- Chunking Theory learning (for simplifier)
- Kolmogorov Complexity applied (for simplifier)
- Simplifier vs Evaluator clean split
- Recording all major philosophical insights cleanly

**Note:** Kleis Grammar v0.2 is a living specification. Adjustments are expected as deeper mathematical structures are encoded.
