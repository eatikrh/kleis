# Note: the ad-hoc static equation editor viewer often uses port 8000 when run via:
#   python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory static
# That 8000 is not wired into the code; it's chosen by the manual command.
# Jupyter typically defaults to port 8888; its port is controlled by the Jupyter invocation,
# not by Kleis binaries. Adjust when launching Jupyter as needed.

# IPC timeouts used by DAP/CLI:
# - short: initial quick poll after starting eval
# - medium: stepping (next/stepIn/stepOut)
# - long: continue (breakpoint or completion)
