# Kleis

**Kleis** is a symbolic language and computational framework for formalizing **Projected Ontology Theory (POT)** and **Hilbert Ontology (HONT)**.

It blends metaphysical clarity with mathematical structure to express concepts like modal flow, projection, residue, bifurcation, and emergent phenomena. Kleis aims to unify ontological reasoning, physics-inspired structure, and symbolic computation under a single formal umbrella.

## üß† What is Kleis?

Kleis serves two main purposes:
1. A **symbolic language** for expressing modal ontological structures.
2. A **Rust-based engine** for parsing, rendering, and evaluating expressions in the Kleis framework.

Kleis is inspired by:
- Functional symbolic systems like **LISP** and **REDUCE**
- Formal language design
- The deep need to represent non-temporal structure, projection mechanics, and modal coherence in a computable and legible way
